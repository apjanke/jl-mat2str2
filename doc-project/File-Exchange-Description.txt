Extended mat2str functionality for Matlab.

It would be nice if mat2str worked on more types and shapes than just 2-D numeric and string matrices.

The jl-mat2str2 library provides extended mat2str functionality for Matlab in the form of a mat2str2 function. Whereas Matlabâ€™s mat2str only works on numerics, strings, and chars, mat2str2 also supports cell, datetime, and table arrays. It also supports matrices with more than 2 dimensions.

mat2str2 is an extension to the mat2str interface, and is back-compatible with it. If MathWorks wanted to, I think they could just roll this functionality into mat2str, and it would work fine.

## Installation

Copy the jl-mat2str2 distribution somewhere on your disk, and add its Mcode/ directory to your Matlab path.

## Usage

Call mat2str2 on your arrays, just as you would with mat2str. See doc mat2str for more info.

## Project

jl-mat2str2 is written by [Andrew Janke](https://apjanke.net).

The project lives on GitHub at <https://github.com/apjanke/jl-mat2str2>.

jl-mat2str2 is part of the Janklab suite of Matlab libraries.
